# Task List

1. ✅ Read all README and documentation files
Reviewed README.md, ROADMAP.md, SPECIFICATION.md, MCP_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/*.md. Identified X11 mentions and existing Wayland support (clipboard).
2. ✅ Search repository for 'X11' occurrences (code + markdown)
Found occurrences in README, roadmap, workflows, implementation guide, code (xdotool, xrandr), clipboard tools, tests.
3. ✅ Replace X11 with Wayland in Markdown files
Updated README system requirements, workflow AppImage readme, implementation guide wording.
4. ✅ Replace X11 with Wayland in code where applicable
Wayland-first: grim capture, swaymsg/hyprctl display info, wl-clipboard clipboard, Wayland cursor attempts; X11 kept as fallback.
5. ✅ Assess Wayland alternatives to X11 functionality
Documented alternatives: grim/slurp, wl-clipboard, swaymsg/hyprctl/wayland-info, kscreen-doctor, xdg-desktop-portal (Screenshot/ScreenCast/RemoteDesktop), PipeWire, wtype/ydotool. C# interop via Tmds.DBus.
6. ✅ Assess clipboard integration via MCP (user->agent and agent->user)
Confirmed implemented tools get_clipboard/set_clipboard. Wayland-first via wl-clipboard. ModeManager may require confirmation. Supports text format currently.
7. ✅ Commit changes to repo with appropriate message
