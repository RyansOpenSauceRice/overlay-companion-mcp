# Task List

1. ✅ Implement native HTTP transport using ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore
✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented native HTTP transport with Server-Sent Events streaming. All tests passing: initialize, tools list, tool execution, screenshot capture, and multi-client support.
2. ✅ Implement multi-monitor support with display detection
✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented multi-monitor support with xrandr/xdpyinfo detection, coordinate translation, monitor-specific overlays and screenshots. All tests passing.
3. ✅ Update documentation to reflect STDIO deprecation
✅ COMPLETED: Updated MCP_SPECIFICATION.md to reflect that HTTP is now the primary transport and STDIO is deprecated (kept for testing only).
4. ✅ Implement missing MCP tools: re_anchor_element and get_display_info
✅ COMPLETED: Both tools successfully implemented and tested. get_display_info provides comprehensive display detection. re_anchor_element supports absolute/relative positioning with boundary clamping.
5. ✅ Test native HTTP transport implementation
✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing successful. HTTP transport working with SSE streaming, multi-client support, CORS, and all MCP protocol features.
6. ✅ Update MCP_SPECIFICATION.md to match actual implementation
✅ COMPLETED: Updated tool count to 15, marked multi-monitor support as implemented, updated HTTP transport documentation, and corrected endpoint URLs.
7. ⏳ Wire scenario-based testing from YAML files
Connect tests/ai-gui/scenarios/basic.yaml to feed test parameters and create comprehensive test scenarios.
8. ⏳ Document the working raw JSON client approach
Create documentation explaining why raw JSON client works vs official SDK, and provide usage examples.
9. ⏳ Clean up temporary test files
Remove debug and test files that are no longer needed
10. ✅ Test multi-monitor functionality once implemented
✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive multi-monitor testing successful. Display detection, coordinate translation, monitor-specific overlays and screenshots all working.
11. ✅ Implement re_anchor_element MCP tool
✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented with absolute/relative positioning modes, boundary clamping, and monitor support. All tests passing.
12. ✅ Add Python linting workflow for multi-language support
✅ COMPLETED: Created comprehensive python-lint.yml workflow with Black, flake8, mypy, bandit, safety, isort, and pylint. Follows existing workflow patterns with path-based triggers and caching.
13. ✅ Fix AppImage build failure in CI/CD pipeline
✅ COMPLETED: Fixed AppStream metadata validation by using reverse DNS notation (io.github.ryansopensaucerice.overlay-companion-mcp), added developer info and content rating, improved error handling to accept validation warnings, and fixed desktop category to use single main category.
14. ✅ Set up automatic development environment for AllHands instances
✅ COMPLETED: Created setup-dev-environment.sh script that automatically installs pre-commit hooks, sets up Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, and configures quality checks. Updated all specification files with setup instructions for AI agents.
