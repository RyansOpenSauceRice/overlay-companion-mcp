# Task List

1. ‚úÖ Analyze the libSkiaSharp.so missing dependency issue in AppImage

Need to modify build-appimage.sh to copy native libraries from dotnet publish output to AppDir/usr/lib
3. ‚è≥ Test the fixed AppImage build and verify GUI initialization works
Build AppImage and test that Avalonia GUI starts without libSkiaSharp errors
4. ‚è≥ Add native library detection and bundling to build script
Ensure all required native dependencies are properly bundled in AppImage
5. ‚è≥ Update documentation with AppImage packaging fixes
Document the native dependency handling in build process
