# AppImage Validation and Error Detection Fixes

## Problem Summary (Legacy)

Note: The project is now web-only. Native GTK/Avalonia desktop UI paths have been removed. The notes below are preserved for historical context in case AppImage packaging is reintroduced for a desktop build in the future.

Previously, the AppImage build could fail with GTK4 dependency errors while GitHub Actions tests still passed (green checkmark) due to inadequate error detection. This created a false sense of success while the AppImage was actually broken.

### Original Errors

1. **GTK4 Dependency Error**: 
   ```
   ERROR: Failed to start GTK4 application: Unable to load shared library 'Gtk' or one of its dependencies
   ```

2. **Masked Test Failures**: Tests used `|| echo "Help test completed"` which always succeeded even on critical failures

3. **Missing System Dependencies**: GTK4 libraries weren't available during CI build, so they weren't bundled into the AppImage

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Test Error Detection (`build-appimage.yml`)

**Before:**
```bash
xvfb-run -a ./app.AppImage --help || echo "Help test completed"
```

**After:**
```bash
if ! xvfb-run -a timeout 30 ./app.AppImage --help > appimage_help_test.log 2>&1; then
  # Check for critical dependency errors that should fail the build
  if grep -q "Unable to load shared library.*Gtk" appimage_help_test.log; then
    echo "❌ CRITICAL: GTK4 dependencies missing from AppImage"
    exit 1
  fi
  # ... additional error checks
fi
```

### 2. Added GTK4 System Dependencies (Historical)

This section applied to the former desktop build. With web-only delivery, GTK4 is no longer required. If reintroducing a desktop build, install comprehensive GTK4 development packages in CI:
```yaml
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libgtk-4-dev \
  libgtk-4-1 \
  pkg-config \
  libglib2.0-dev \
  libcairo2-dev \
  libpango1.0-dev \
  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev \
  libgraphene-1.0-dev \
  libepoxy-dev
```

### 3. Created Comprehensive Validation Script (Applies to any AppImage)

**New file: `scripts/validate-appimage.sh`**

Features:
- ✅ File property validation (executable, size)
- ✅ AppImage extraction testing
- ✅ Required file verification
- ✅ GTK4 dependency checking
- ✅ Runtime execution testing with timeout
- ✅ Critical error pattern detection
- ✅ Detailed diagnostic output

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/validate-appimage.sh path/to/app.AppImage
```

### 4. Enhanced Build Script Diagnostics

Improved `scripts/build-appimage.sh` to provide better feedback:
- Shows available libraries in AppDir
- Checks system GTK4 availability
- Provides clear warnings when GTK4 isn't bundled

### 5. Added Pre-commit Validation Hooks (General)

Enhanced `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with:
- Build script executable permission checks
- AppImage validation (if present)
- GitHub Actions workflow syntax validation
- npm cache configuration validation

## Testing the Fixes

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test the validation script
./scripts/validate-appimage.sh build/overlay-companion-mcp-*.AppImage

# Run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### CI Testing
The updated workflow will now:
1. Install GTK4 dependencies during build
2. Bundle GTK4 libraries into AppImage
3. Run comprehensive validation
4. Fail fast on critical dependency errors

## Expected Outcomes

### Before Fixes
- ❌ GTK4 errors hidden by `|| echo` statements
- ❌ Tests pass despite broken AppImage
- ❌ No early detection of dependency issues
- ❌ Poor diagnostic information

### After Fixes
- ✅ Critical errors cause build failures
- ✅ GTK4 libraries bundled in AppImage (desktop build only)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation with clear diagnostics
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks catch issues early
- ✅ Better error reporting and debugging info

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Dependency Detection**: Could enhance the build script to automatically detect and bundle all required native dependencies

2. **Cross-platform Testing**: Add validation for different Linux distributions to ensure broader compatibility

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track AppImage startup time and size to detect regressions

4. **Integration Testing**: Add tests that verify MCP functionality works correctly in the AppImage environment

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Run `pre-commit install` to enable automatic validation
2. Use `./scripts/validate-appimage.sh` to test AppImages locally
3. Check CI logs for detailed validation output

### For CI/CD
1. The build will now fail fast on critical dependency errors
2. Validation logs provide detailed diagnostic information
3. AppImage artifacts are only uploaded if validation passes

This comprehensive approach ensures that AppImage builds are properly validated and critical errors are caught early in the development process.
## Current State

- The application runs as a web-first MCP server with HTTP transport at root "/" and a browser overlay viewer served from wwwroot.
- STDIO is retained only for legacy/testing.
- Desktop GUI artifacts (GTK/Avalonia) are excluded from the build. Any future reintroduction should revisit this document.
