# Task List

1. ✅ Implement native HTTP transport using ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore
✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented native HTTP transport with Server-Sent Events streaming. All tests passing: initialize, tools list, tool execution, screenshot capture, and multi-client support.
2. ✅ Implement multi-monitor support with display detection
✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented multi-monitor support with xrandr/xdpyinfo detection, coordinate translation, monitor-specific overlays and screenshots. All tests passing.
3. ⏳ Update documentation to reflect STDIO deprecation
Note that STDIO is kept for testing but HTTP is the primary transport going forward
4. ✅ Implement missing MCP tools: re_anchor_element and get_display_info
✅ COMPLETED: Both tools successfully implemented and tested. get_display_info provides comprehensive display detection. re_anchor_element supports absolute/relative positioning with boundary clamping.
5. ✅ Test native HTTP transport implementation
✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing successful. HTTP transport working with SSE streaming, multi-client support, CORS, and all MCP protocol features.
6. ⏳ Update MCP_SPECIFICATION.md to match actual implementation
Updated HTTP transport and multi-monitor sections. Still need to update tool count and missing tools documentation.
7. ⏳ Wire scenario-based testing from YAML files
Connect tests/ai-gui/scenarios/basic.yaml to feed test parameters and create comprehensive test scenarios.
8. ⏳ Document the working raw JSON client approach
Create documentation explaining why raw JSON client works vs official SDK, and provide usage examples.
9. ⏳ Clean up temporary test files
Remove debug and test files that are no longer needed
10. ✅ Test multi-monitor functionality once implemented
✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive multi-monitor testing successful. Display detection, coordinate translation, monitor-specific overlays and screenshots all working.
11. ✅ Implement re_anchor_element MCP tool
✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented with absolute/relative positioning modes, boundary clamping, and monitor support. All tests passing.
